            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi! My name is Wonjae Suh, and I am an undergraduate student of Harvard's Class of 2027. I am a sophomore residing in Lowell House, and I am thinking of pursuing a Double Concentration of Honors Mathematics and Physics with a Concurrent Masters in Physics. Upon graduation, I would like to pursue a PhD in Mathematics. At Harvard, I am a writer and photographer for The Harvard Crimson's Arts and Multimedia boards, where I serve as the Arts Multimedia Executive. I am also an active member of the Harvard College Korean International Students Association, where I served as a Freshman Representative. Besides writing and photography, my hobbies include breakdancing, skateboarding, cross-country running, and weight lifting.

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Fall of 2024, I am a Course Assistant for Math 122, a first course in Abstract Algebra. This semester I am taking Math 114 (Functional Analysis), Math 231A ([Graduate] Algebraic Topology), Math 232A ([Graduate] Algebraic Geometry), 18.705 ([Graduate] Commutative Algebra), and GENED 1185 (Armenian Art History).

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Summer of 2024, I conducted research through the University's PRISE Fellowship, <a href="https://www.childrenshospital.org/directory/alexander-rotenberg">
                under Dr. Alexander Rotenberg at the Boston's Children Hospital.</a> My research was an independent project involving applications of topological data analysis and Markov chains with memory to arrive at an unbiased approach of determining the efficacy of gene therapy treatment with behavior as a proxy. My proposal can be found under "<a href="projects.html">Projects</a>."
